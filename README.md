# ArraysLeftRotation

A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left by one position and the first element becomes the last.

For example, 
 - if 1 (one) left rotations are performed on array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  , then the array would become [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 1].
 - if 2 (two) left rotations are performed on array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  , then the array would become [ 3, 4, 5, 1, 2] and so on;
 
 Given an array of <b>n</b> integers and a number, <b>d</b> , perform <b>d</b> left rotations on the array. 
 Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
